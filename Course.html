                <span class="course-level1">Level 1</span>
                <p>Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many information technology systems. 
                    Students learn the fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. 
                    Students design and create databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization. 
                    Students become familiar with the functions of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.</p>

                <h3>My First CSS Work</h3>
                <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of headings and links. <br>It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. <br>It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>
